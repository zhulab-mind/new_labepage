After all this time, I didn't realize that there even was a Decision Lab pizza 
place! This evening the lab piled into my minivan for a trip out to North Beach 
for pizza and pasta at Il Casaro -- and later, yummy cannolis and cookies. We're 
wishing a fond farewell to two longtime lab members. 
[Rea](/team/index.html#Rea-Antoniou) has been with the Decision Lab and the 
[Rankin Lab](https://rankinlabucsf.wordpress.com/) since before the pandemic, 
and in addition to amazing science has done so much to help support everyone in 
our lab and Kate's lab during some very challenging years. Meanwhile, 
[Brandon](/team/index.html#Brandon-Leggins) first joined the lab in 2021 (he had 
to start remotely); it's been awesome to see him develop and refine his interests 
while in lab, and lab meetings just won't be the same without the Kobe memes. 

Best of luck to both of you -- so proud!
