Congratulations to our fearless leader, [Winston](/team/index.html#Winston-Chiong), who was officially
appointed as the Executive Director of [UCSF Bioethics](https://bioethics.ucsf.edu/)!

Serving as Interim Director of UCSF Bioethics since late October 2021, Winston has worked to strengthen 
our interdisciplinary community of discourse on responsible clinical practice, discovery, and education in
the context of broader and long-overdue discussions about justice and health equity throughout our institution. 
As Executive Director, he will be responsible for the integration of bioethics as an integral component of 
UCSFâ€™s research, training, and clinical missions. Way to go!
