We had a very successful but exhausting week in lab, submitting a grant 
application and also hosting 
[Roy Hamilton](/team/index.html#Roy-Hamilton) for two inspiring talks about 
[diversity, equity and inclusion in neurology](https://calendar.ucsf.edu/event/neurology-DEI-grand-rounds){:target="_blank"} 
and about 
[noninvasive brain stimulation in aphasia syndromes](https://calendar.ucsf.edu/event/memory_and_aging_center_grand_rounds_7359){:target="_blank"}. It was 
especially great to host Roy in person given all the work he's done to inspire 
and inform our efforts at creating a more inclusive lab, Memory and Aging 
Center, and Department of Neurology.

To celebrate we gathered for our first lab lunch in a long while, also 
celebrating UCSF's return to work and our beautiful new office space in the 
[Weill Neurosciences Building](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/lp/weill-neurosciences-building){:target="_blank"}, 
which we finally get to enjoy together. So glad to be able to share each others' 
company and conversation with delicious dumplings!
