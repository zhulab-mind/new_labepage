[Clara Sanches](/team/index.html#Clara-Sanches) presented her poster at the 
Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting in Washington DC, on a drift-diffusion 
model analysis of cognitive slowing in aging. In contrast with many prior 
studies comparing cohorts of younger and older adults (in which variability in 
recruitment across cohorts can lead to uncontrolled differences), or studies 
analyzing parameters derived from a single task, this work analyzes the effect 
of age as a continuous variable across a single cohort of older adults verified 
as neurologically healthy, in three quite different task contexts 
(decision-making, emotion recognition, and memory).
