Well, this perfectly mediocre season has been a bit of a letdown for the 
Giants, just a year after a tremendously fun season. However, this final home 
game of the season is probably the best game we've attended as a lab. (Sadly, 
no one remembered to take pictures on June 7, though that game was pretty 
boring anyway.) 

In this case we got to hang out together on a sunny day with a great view, also 
with some very cute kids and _both_ garlic fries and regular fries. And a really 
fun game with lead changes, action (Giants ended multiple innings with double 
plays to wipe out a runner crossing the plate) and an extra-innings walkoff with 
a play at the plate! Can't wait for next year!
