Tonight we shared a lot of laughs and also a few tears to celebrate two lab members who have brought so 
much to our group, and who are now moving on to exciting new phases of their careers. I am so proud of 
[Ali Zahir](/team/index.html#Ali-Zahir) and [Mia Borzello](/team/index.html#Mia-Borzello), leaving the lab 
for medical school at UCSF and a PhD in Cognitive Science at UCSD (respectively), and grateful 
for all they have done to help grow our lab. I'm so glad we had a gather and commemorate 
the time we've spent together, over vegan sushi (yum!) and vegan cheesecake (ehh...). Can't wait to see 
what you two do next, and also to catch up the next time you're in town (Mia) or break free from 
exams and rotations (Ali)!
