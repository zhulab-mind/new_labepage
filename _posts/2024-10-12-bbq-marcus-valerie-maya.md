For this year's Decision Lab fall BBQ, we welcomed 
[Marcus](/team/index.html#Marcus-Piattoni), 
[Valerie](/team/index.html#Valerie-Black), and 
[Maya](/team/index.html#Maya-Hunt) to the lab. Marcus is a new research 
coordinator with a background in neuroscience and bioethics. Valerie is a 
postdoc supporting our empirical ethics projects; she trained in cultural and 
medical anthropology at UC Berkeley. Meanwhile, Maya is currently the course 
assistant for UCSF's human subjects Responsible Conduct of Research course, but 
will be joining the lab soon to think about neuroethics. 

In addition, we were really happy to be joined by some Decision Lab alums, 
[Cailin](/team/index.html#Cailin-Lechner) (now an attorney working on 
disability and health care advocacy), [Madhu](/team/index.html#Madhu-Manivannan) 
(now a pediatrics intern at Benioff Children's Oakland), 
[Celeste](/team/index.html#Celeste-Fong) (now a clinical ethics fellow at 
Sutter), and [Clayton](/team/index.html#Clayton-Young), a data engineer for a 
neuroscience startup. So glad they could share ther experiences in lab with our 
new arrivals, and it was great to hear more about how their lives and careers 
have developed!
