We took a year off from Decision Lab BBQ and were pleased to be be back 
together in person for hamburgers, steak, jerk chicken, shrimp... okay, too much 
food. (Got excited, it's been a while!) Originally not planned as a Halloween 
party but pushed back a week because of an "atmospheric river." Was very fun to 
see some lab members' costumes; also, everyone got to meet Jordy the corgi 
puppy. 

As another announcement, I have been named the interim Director of 
[UCSF Bioethics](https://bioethics.ucsf.edu). It's been great to have this opportunity 
to share ideas about needs and opportunities with other involved members of our 
campus community; we've got some exciting plans for the coming year!
