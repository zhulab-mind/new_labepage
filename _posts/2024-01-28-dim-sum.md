Another goodbye for the lab, but fortunately [Celeste Fong](/team/index.html#Celeste-Fong)
will not be going too far away. Instead, she'll be joining the 
[Sutter Health Program in Medicine and Human Values](https://www.sutterhealth.org/cpmc/services/bioethics) 
as a clinical ethics fellow. We're super excited that she's found such a great role for 
her interests, and even more excited that she's staying in San Francisco! Since she 
missed our last dim sum outing, it was only right to go out and reminisce over 
dumplings and noodles!
