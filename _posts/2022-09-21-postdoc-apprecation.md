It's Postdoc Appreciation Week again! [Clara Sanches](/team/index.html#Clara-Sanches) 
and I went out for a coffee and a chat. While trying to avoid talking about her 
upcoming SfN poster, we got to discussing Julia Brown's great recent 
[book launch event](https://theochocolate.com/){:target="\_blank"}, through which 
I learned from Clara about Esm√© Weijun Wang's fascinating collection, 
_The Collected Schizophrenias_. Really looking forward to checking it out once 
this coming set of grants is in!...
