Capping off a productive week of posters in the Decision Lab, 
[Narayan Sankaran](/team/index.html#Narayan-Sankaran) received a poster award at 
the International Neuroethics Society's 2024 meeting in Baltimore for his 
poster, on "Disparate ethical responses to speech decoding research." Narayan's 
project is focused on (1) unpacking an ethical tension exhibited in many responses 
to the ongoing development of speech BCIs (brain-computer interfaces), between 
support for restoration and concerns about surveillance, and (2) drawing upon 
details of the neuroscience of speech and on community engagement to chart a 
path forward. Congrats also to Narayan on his upcoming faculty appointment at 
the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/programs/undergraduate/neuroscience/program-overview)!

In my view, this year's 
[INS program](https://www.neuroethicssociety.org/2024-annual-meeting-schedule) 
was the most well-developed and engaging so far. In addition to exciting
integrations with the arts, the program included illuminating international 
discussions (particularly with expertise from Japan and Latin America) and 
really thoughtful incorporation of considerations of society and the social 
sciences. Looking forward to next year in Munich!
