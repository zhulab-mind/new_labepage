It's been a busy week for the Decision Lab at both the International 
Neuroethics Society Annual Meeting and Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting 
in Chicago! To start us off, [Cailin Lechner](/team/index.html#Cailin-Lechner) 
presented this work on who should obtain informed consent in human intracranial 
electrophysiological research studies. This builds off of work developed by 
JC Mergenthaler last year; we're also excited about other work that Cailin is 
beginning on how to improve consent processes in such research!
