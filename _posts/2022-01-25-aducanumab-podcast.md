I got to have another great conversation with Dr. Jeff Ratliff for 
the _Neurology_ journal podcast. When he had me on [last time](/news/2021/neurology-podcast) 
to talk about dementia ethics more generally, I wasn't able to talk yet about the 
[position statement](/papers/index.html#Decisions-with-patients-and-families-regarding-aducanumab-in-Alzheimer-disease,-with-recommendations-for-consent:-AAN-position-statement) 
that our committee has been preparing to address the many challenges raised 
in decision-making regarding this controversal new drug. In this discussion we 
considered how to counsel patients and families given the drug's lack of 
established benefit, known harms, potential negative effects on the entire 
Medicare system, and health equity concerns given the exclusion of Black, 
Indigneous and Hispanic patients from pivotal clinical trials. At the end, Dr. Ratliff 
asked a tough question about a scenario in which a patient really 
desires treatment; I did my best to illustrate how frameworks of shared 
decision-making may be helpful in such situations.
