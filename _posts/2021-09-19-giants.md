We got a chance to enjoy some lovely weather and views, and garlic fries 
(except Brandon), in the middle of a great playoff race--even if the game itself 
was a little disappointing. It was great to finally meet 
[Brandon](/team/index.html#Brandon-Leggins) in person, to catch up with 
[Cailin](/team/index.html#Cailin-Lechner), and to welcome 
[Helena](/team/index.html#Helena-Mezgova) and 
[Steve](/team/index.html#Steven-Lenio) to the group. Here's hoping that the 
Giants continue to give us something to root for into October!

Also, two days after this we got together again for Ethiopian food 
(Brandon-approved) and 
[Postdoc Appreciation Week](https://postdocs.ucsf.edu/npaw){:target="\_blank"}. 
Thanks so much 
[Toby](/team/index.html#Tobias-Haeusermann), 
[Clara](/team/index.html#Clara-Sanches) and 
[Colin](/team/index.html#Colin-Hoy) for all that you bring to the team!
