It's that time of the year again... We're saying goodbye to Bryan, Steve, and Danielle. [Bryan](/team/index.html#Bryan-Chen), who has been working with us
as a student intern for nearly 2 years, has graduated from Columbia University. He will remain in the city as a research worker under [Dr. Yunglin Gazes](https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/yunglin-gazes-phd)
in the Taub Institute at Columbia Medical Center. [Danielle](/team/index.html#Danielle-Hart) has completed her research year with us and will be continuing onto her 4th year 
of medical school at UCSF. [Steve](/team/index.html#Steven-Lenio) has finished his behavioral neurology fellowship at UCSF and has accepted a full-time position as Assistant Professor of 
Neurology at Boston University. It's always sad to part with people who have contributed so dearly to the lab's work and social culture, but we are excited to see them moving on to 
accomplish great things!
