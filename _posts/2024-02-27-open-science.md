Today in place of our usual weekly code meeting, we instead were invited to 
present at a virtual meetup of the 
[Bay Area Open Science Group](https://bayareaopensciencegroup.github.io/), 
a community spanning UCSF, UC Berkeley, and Stanford. We had a fascinating 
discussion about open science and different norms across a wide range of 
scientific disciplines--at a health sciences university, we don't often have the 
chance for such wide ranging discussions about rigor and method. And it was 
flattering to know that people outside the lab had found the 
[Decision Lab Handbook](/handbook/) useful!
