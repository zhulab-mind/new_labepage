It was great to see both [Emily Liu](/team/index.html#Emily-Liu) and 
[Narayan Sankaran](/team/index.html#Narayan-Sankaran) on stage at the 
[10th Annual BRAIN Initiative Conference](https://brainmeeting.swoogo.com/2024/home). 

Emily was one of eight Scholar Spotlight awardees selected to give a Lightning 
Talk of her abstract to the full meeting, immediately after NIH BRAIN Director 
John Ngai's welcome. Then in the afternoon, Narayan spoke as part of a panel 
on music in the brain (and its potential therapeutic applications), presenting 
cutting-edge work on neural representations of melody in the brain. 

Emily and Narayan will both be going on to faculty roles; Emily at the 
University of Colorado Department of Neurology, and Narayan helping to establish 
a new Neuroscience department close to home at the University of San Francisco, 
and aiming also to set up a neuroethics program within that department. Great 
work by both of them -- so happy to see it recognized!
