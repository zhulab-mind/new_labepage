It was such a unique experience to participate at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center (MAC) Research Staff Retreat. On the 25th of October, the decision lab gathered together at the San Francisco Zoo. 
We had the opportunity to bond and get to know better other MAC members, while feeding alpacas and hanging out with lemurs.  Our picture bellow certainly conveys our excitement!
