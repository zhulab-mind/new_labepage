Many congratulations to super UCSF med students 
[Abraham Dada](/team/index.html#Abraham-Dada) and 
[Danielle Hart](/team/index.html#Danielle-Hart), who presented their posters at 
the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in Boston. 

Abe's poster, "Factors mediating public perceptions of therapeutic closed-loop 
brain implants for epilepsy and mood disorders," included data from a national 
survey characterizing mediators of demographic differences in the prospecive 
acceptability of closed loop implanted devices. Danielle's poster, "Financial 
toxicity in dementia caregiving," included data from a national survey of 
dementia caregivers indicating that Black, non-Hispanic caregivers were more 
likely to experience financial toxicity than white, non-Hispanic caregivers; 
with age as a somewhat surprising protective factor.
