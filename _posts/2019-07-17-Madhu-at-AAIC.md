More posters from the Decision Lab! Here is [Madhu Manivannan](/team/index.html#Madhu-Manivannan) with new 
qualitative work on addressing financial vulnerability in dementia within the 
[Care Ecosystem](https://memory.ucsf.edu/research-trials/professional/care-ecosystem){:target="_blank"}. 
(Madhu is representing the lab alongside a huge contingent from the UCSF Memory and Aging Center and 
Global Brain Health Institute at the 
[Alzheimer's Association International Conference](https://www.alz.org/aaic/overview.asp){:target="_blank"} 
in LA.) We're looking forward to hearing feedback on this project!
