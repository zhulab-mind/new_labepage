I really enjoyed this interview with Dr. Jeff Ratliff for the _Neurology_ 
journal podcast regarding our recent AAN Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee 
[position statement](/papers/index.html#-Ethical-considerations-in-dementia-diagnosis-and-care:-AAN-position-statement) 
about ethical issues in dementia. We got to talk about a broad range of topics 
even in a brief interview, such as problems that come up from the language we 
use about dementia, the difficult issue of truth-telling about a diagnosis that 
family members may lead to emotional harms, decisions about nursing home 
placement, and issues raised by new treatments like aducanumab. For the latter, 
while our position statement was formulated and reviewed by the different 
neurological societies prior to aducanumab's approval, there are some broad 
issues (including capacity assessment, awareness of financial strains in 
dementia, and the exacerbation of racial and ethnic disparities) that this 
new drug illustrates.
