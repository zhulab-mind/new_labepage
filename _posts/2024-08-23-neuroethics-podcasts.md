Members of the lab have been interviewed for two podcast episodes about 
challenging topics in clinical neuroethics. First, 
[Colin Hoy](/team/index.html#Colin-Hoy) was interviewed 
for the [_Neurology_](https://www.neurology.org) podcast to discuss ethical 
considerations around the diagnosis of prodromal Parkinson's disease, a companion 
to an [editorial](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209522) that Colin and I 
wrote:

Second, I got to have a fun conversation for the 
[GeriPal](https://geripal.org/) (Geriatrics and Palliative Care) podcast with 
Sean Aas, prompted by Sean's thought-provoking recent 
[article](https://academic.oup.com/jmp/article-abstract/49/4/399/7665406?redirectedFrom=fulltext) 
on philosophical and conceptual problems with brain death. (A topic I haven't 
written about in a long time, but which I may need to return to...)
