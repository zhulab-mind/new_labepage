It's time again to gather and send off another member of lab to the next stage 
in their career. But this time, [Clayton](/team/index.html#Clayton-Young) won't 
be going far. To further an interest in data science that Clayton developed 
during his time in Decision Lab, Clayton is staying at the Memory and Aging 
Center but moving to our MAC Technology Team! We look forward to bombarding 
Clayton with late-night emergency requests about password resets, network drive 
mounting errors, file backups and journal article permissions. Hopefully 
[Celeste](/team/index.html#Celeste-Fong) lets him stay on lab Slack...
