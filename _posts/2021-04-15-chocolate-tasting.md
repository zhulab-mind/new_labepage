It was great to gather with the Decision Lab, the 
[Medical Cultures Lab](https://www.cultureofmedicine.org/){:target="\_blank"}, 
and so many [Decision Lab alums](/team/index.html#alumni) for an online 
chocolate tasting hosted by [Theo Chocolates](https://theochocolate.com/){:target="\_blank"}. 
We all had a chance to enjoy one another's company, make jokes on the chat, 
learn a little bit about chocolate fermentation and tempering, and taste a lot 
of delicious chocolate!
