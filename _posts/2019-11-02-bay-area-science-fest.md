The Decision Lab had the opportunity to host a table at Discovery Day at Oracle Park, part of the Bay Area Science Festival.
This is a free educational event where people of all ages learn about health, medicine, science, engineering, and more. Our group
worked together to design four creative, kid-friendly games to teach the Bay Area public about decision-making, morality, and ethics.
We had a lot of fun coming up with the games, getting to do some arts and crafts, and engaging with the unique, brilliant, and curious
bay area community!
