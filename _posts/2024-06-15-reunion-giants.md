Today we went out for another game together at Oracle Park, and we were able to 
celebrate the return to the Bay Area of two Decision Lab alums, 
[Clayton](/team/index.html#Clayton-Young) & [Madhu](/team/index.html#Madhu-Manivannan). 
A few other Decision Lab alums came to join us for a mini-lab reunion: 
[Ali](/team/index.html#Ali-Zahir), [Cailin](/team/index.html#Cailin-Lechner), 
and [Celeste](/team/index.html#Celeste-Fong)! It was great to see everyone and 
get updates on the great things that people have been up to since leaving 
the lab!
