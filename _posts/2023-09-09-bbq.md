After a one-year hiatus due to a kitchen remodel, we're back for another 
Decision Lab BBQ! This time we are welcoming 
[Manizhe](/team/index.html#Manizhe-Eslami-Amirabadi) and 
[Pongpat](/team/index.html#Pongpat-Putthinun) to the lab. Manizhe is a 
behavioral neurologist from Iran via Boston, while Pongpat is a health economist 
from Thailand via Hiroshima! Very excited to have them join us, bringing their 
talents and new perspectives!
