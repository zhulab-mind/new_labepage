This year the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting is in Denver, where 
[Manizhe Eslami-Amirabadi](/team/index.html#Manizhe-Eslami-Amirabadi) and 
[UCSF neurology resident](https://neuroresidency.ucsf.edu/current-residents) 
Michael Trainer presented their work. 

Manizhe presented "Financial activities and mismanagement by people with 
dementia as reported in a nationally representative caregiver survey," which 
takes a new approach to estimating the impact of disease-related impairments 
in decision-making. Michael presented "Ethical shared decision-making for novel 
anti-amyloid therapies," which applies prior work on tools for improving shared 
decision-making (mostly utilized so far in non-neurologic disorders) to the 
complex decisions facing clinicians, patients, and families regarding new 
biologically-based treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Congrats to both of them, 
and thanks to everyone who came out to ask questions and give feedback!
