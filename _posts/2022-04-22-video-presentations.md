I recently had the chance to give two presentations about neuroethics, which 
(for better or worse) are recorded on YouTube. On April 5 I was invited to the 
[University of Washington Electrical & Computer Engineering Colloquium](https://www.ece.uw.edu/colloquia/winston-chiong/){:target="_blank"} 
to present on "Patient experiences with implanted closed-loop neuromodulation as 
inputs for human-centered design"--had a wonderful series of very interesting 
conversations with faculty in engineering and in bioethics during my visit to 
Seattle:

On April 9 I got to participate in a great panel discussion as part of the 
[Science Ethics and Policy Symposium](https://seps2022.sched.com/event/xIqp/neuroethics-and-the-law-privacy-in-the-age-of-neuroscience){:target="_blank"} 
on the UC Berkeley campus, with the always-thoughtful 
[Sara Goering](https://phil.washington.edu/people/sara-goering){:target="_blank"} 
(yes of course, also at UW!) and moderated by 
[Narayan Sankaran](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/narayan.sankaran){:target="_blank"}:
