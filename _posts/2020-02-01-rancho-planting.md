The Decision Lab trekked out to the coastal woodlands of Rancho Corral de Tierra in San Mateo County to volunteer with the
Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy. We used short pick-axes to collectively plant 196 bunches of native grass on the hills
of the preserve, which will create pockets of open land for endangered plants to grow in. It was a beautiful Saturday morning
filled with dirt-covered earthworms, interesting and obscure plant facts, and great company!
