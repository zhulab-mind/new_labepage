We seek a highly motivated and collaborative postdoctoral scholar to join an 
interdisciplinary research program on experiences of dementia and of 
dementia caregiving. This work will be directed by 
[Winston Chiong, MD PhD]({{ '/team/index.html#Winston-Chiong' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})

neuroscience in the UCSF Decision Lab, in the
