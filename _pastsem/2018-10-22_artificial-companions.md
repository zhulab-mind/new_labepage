UCSF Assistant Professor of Sociology [Elena Portacolone](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/elena.portacolone){:target="\blank"} 
explained the genesis of her work-in-progress on the ethical 
conundrums of artificial companions designed for adults with cognitive impairment, and solicited feedback from the group. 
We specifically discussed issues associated with a pet avatar that expresses words of affection and is controlled by 
remote technicians. Throughout our conversation, problems of deception, privacy, and informed consent proved to be ethical 
grey areas. 


At its worst, the avatar promotes an illusory companionship that detracts from real human interaction, and unknowingly 
surveils users, thereby violating their right to privacy. At its best, it comforts people without access to a human support 
network, serves an affordable care option, postpones the need for institutionalized living, and ameliorates feelings of 
loneliness. We addressed the tradeoff between privacy and companionship, as well as the challenge of establishing an informed 
consent process for an inherently deceptive product, the benefit of which might be lost upon drawing back the curtain on 
its behind-the-scenes operations. We referred to an earlier seminar on [dementia villages](/pastsem/2018-06-11_dementia-villages/) 
and a recent [New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/08/the-comforting-fictions-of-dementia-care){:target="\_blank"} 
when evaluating this controversial approach to care, which may support patientsâ€™ subjective wellbeing and happiness while reinforcing their 
altered sense of reality. Regarding insufficient regulation of artificial companion technologies, we were concerned about 
the lack of public awareness of the lag between innovation and policy.
