In a journal club led by Jalayne Arias, Renaud La Joie, and Jen Yokoyama, we discussed consent for 
data sharing within dementia research, focusing on arguments presented in [*Consent recommendations 
for research and international data sharing involving persons with dementia*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30293575){:target="_blank"} by Adrian Thorogood et al. 


Jalayne initially provided an historical review of the Bermuda Policies, the Henrietta Lacks case, and *Havasupai Tribe 
of Havasupai Reservation v. Arizona Board of Regents*. With this background in mind, some felt that the article missed an 
opportunity to address issues unique to patients with dementia 
and to data sharing in a research context. Rather than describing the complexity of capacity assessment for individuals 
with varying degrees of cognitive impairment, the difficulty of balancing duty to protect patients from exploitation and
duty to respect patients’ right to participate in research, or the barrier to international research collaboration presented 
by inconsistent data sharing laws, the article addresses vulnerable populations and consenting challenges in general. Members 
of our group shared personal experiences addressing contradictory patient and caregiver claims, managing double 
de-identified patient data, and hesitating to share data within a competitive research environment. It can be a challenge to 
clarify the concept of data sharing so as to accurately inform patients and debunk slippery slope
arguments about what researchers can and cannot achieve with an individual’s data.


Reflecting on public mistrust of biomedical research as a result of infamous studies, like the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, 
we emphasized our responsibility to cultivate a positive relationship between research participants and UCSF as an institution. 
We also recognized the public’s call for penalizing researchers who violate data sharing policies beyond academic black listing. 
Regarding research involving disenfranchised or stereotyped groups, we deliberated the possibility of including a community 
representative within the consent committee.
