On the last neuroethics seminar before our unexpected hiatus, 
[Yvonne Kapila](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/yvonne.kapila){:target="\_blank"} and 
Ahmed Alsaleh joined us to discuss informed consent guidelines for dental 
and periodontology care in older, cognitively impaired adults. Periodontal disease is often overlooked in patients with dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, yet 
the prevalence of both cognitive impairments and periodontal diseases increases with age. Yvonne and Ahmed introduced several case studies where patients with varying 
degrees of cognitive impairments underwent care for dental implants and dental infections. In these cases, informed consent procedures created challenges for 
clinicians who wondered if patients with impairments could adequately understand and consent to invasive procedures, some of which must occur over the span of
several months and years. 

The discussion focused on the risks and benefits of ongoing dental and periodontal care in older populations. As oral hygiene becomes more difficult, elder 
adults become susceptible to issues like root decay, dry mouth, osteonecrosis, and infection. However, dental restorations themselves can negatively impact 
quality of life in these same individuals, as dentures and dental prostheses require extensive maintenance and can come with a number of complications like 
infection. By the end of the discussion, the group wondered about the feasibility of implementing bioethical consults for dentistry or documents like dental
directives. The discussion also underscored the importance of ethical frameworks of care for patients whose clinical indications require treatment regardless
of cognitive status, as well as ongoing interdisciplinary collaborations between neurologists, geriatricians, and dentists.
