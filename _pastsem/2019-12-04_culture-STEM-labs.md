The final seminar of the year featured a works-in-progress by Dan Dohan. The 
group helped him brainstorm ideas for a grant he is 
interested in developing on cultures of responsible research in STEM 
laboratories. Our meeting began with an overview of social theories
of culture, as explained by Lizardo and Strand in their 
[article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X09000606?via%3Dihub){:target="_blank"}, 
“Skills, toolkits, contexts, and institutions: Clarifying the relationship between different approaches to cognition in cultural 
sociology.” We compared four approaches and perspectives of culture: classic anthropology, classic sociology, contemporary anthropology,
and contemporary sociology. 

In contemporary sociology, culture, that is, our ideology, values, or norms, are more powerful when times
are socially unsettled – we tend to rely on them more to guide practice. On the other hand, during settled times, culture can work like 
a toolkit, where we can do things in ways that feel natural to us as individuals instead of relying on particular values or norms. 
These toolkits form cognition because they are ingrained into how we think and act.

Technological advances can regularly unsettle biological science fields and raise new ethical concerns. Our discussion explored how 
particular sites in biological science fields do or do not display lab culture, including how to identify the inherited values of team 
members that have followed them through their experiences, and how their resulting behaviors in new or different groups can change or 
upset existing ethical cultures. We also spent some time creating strategies to identify the goals of calls for grants that institutions 
put out, as these institutions have particular ideas and thinking about culture engrained in them already.
