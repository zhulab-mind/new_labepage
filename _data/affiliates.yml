  description: I'm a neuroscientist and postdoctoral scholar in the UCSF 
              Movement Disorders and Neuromodulation Center studying motivation 
              in Parkinson's disease with Drs. Simon Little and Phil Starr and 
              neuroethics here in the Decision Lab. 


               In the Little and Starr Labs, our group aims to treat motor and 
               nonmotor (e.g., sleep, cognition, emotion) deficits in patients 
               with Parkinson's disease using neurosurgically implanted deep 
               brain stimulation (DBS) devices. My main research project focuses 
               on understanding apathy and impulsivity symptoms in these 
               patients by (1) measuring goal-directed and habitual decision 
               making with computational reinforcement learning models; 
               (2) mapping these cognitive processes to neural activity using 
               chronic invasive brain recordings; and (3) modulating these 
               neural circuits using dopaminergic medications and DBS. 


               In the Decision Lab, I'm studying bioethics to better understand 
               the ethical, legal, and social implications of neurotechnology. 
               For example, if brain stimulation can alter motivation or other 
               aspects of one's personality and identity, how should we deploy 
               and regulate these treatments? I hope that combining neuroethics 
               with my basic and clinical neuroscience research will help inform 
               guidelines for the responsible use of neurotechnology. 


               I graduated in 2012 from Hendrix College with a BA in 
               Neuroscience before spending two years as a postbaccalaureate 
               researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health working on 
               functional MRI methods. In 2021, I graduated from UC Berkeley 
               with a PhD in Neuroscience in which I studied cognitive control 
               using intracranial brain recordings from epilepsy patients. 
               Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, hiking, 
               kayaking, and camping.

  description: I am a recent graduate of Santa Clara University, where I 
              majored in Neuroscience with an emphasis on Applied Ethics. Early 
              in my academic career at SCU, I took a wide range of courses-- from 
              Western Philosophy and Informal Logic to Neuroethics. I became
              deeply interested in understanding the root of the "why" behind
              human behavior and thought. Neuroscience felt like the right
              path to satisfy my existing curiosities and promote further
              intellectual growth. I soon developed a strong interest in the 
              ethical considerations required to navigate the relationship 
              between technology and the brain. 


              Through various coursework, I explored the ethical and neurological 
              implications of emerging neurotechnologies. I became fascinated by 
              how these innovations can empower, complicate, and challenge our 
              approach to mental health, neurological disorders, and aging.


              During my final quarter, I worked with an older individual 
              experiencing memory impairments, administering psychological tests
              and managing clinical data. This hands-on experience was deeply 
              fulfilling and insightful. After graduation, I worked for a 
              longevity start-up, where I had the opportunity to create a 
              comprehensive framework for guiding ethical decision-making in 
              neuropsychological testing and treatment. These back-to-back
              experiences reinforced my commitment to understanding the 
              nuances of technology in healthcare and clinical practice with 
              empathy.

              
              I am grateful for this opportunity to broaden my learning and expand
              my research experience. 

             
              In my spare time, I enjoy yoga, photography, hiking, and watching movies.
