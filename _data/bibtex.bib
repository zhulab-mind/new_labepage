Background and Purpose - Slow recruitment in acute stroke trials hampers the evaluation of new therapies and delays the adoption of effective therapies into clinical practice. This systematic review evaluates whether recruitment efficiency and rates have increased in acute stroke trials from 1990 to 2014. Methods - Acute stroke trials from 2010 to 2014 were identified by a search of PubMed, Medline, the Cochrane Database of Research in Stroke, and the Stroke Trials Registry. These trials were compared to a previously published data set of trials conducted from 1990 to 2004. Results - The median recruitment efficiency of trials from 1990 to 2004 was 0.41 participants/site/month compared with 0.26 participants/site/month from 2010 to 2014 (P=0.14). The median recruitment rate of trials from 1990 to 2004 was 26.8 participants/month compared with 19.0 participants/month from 2010 to 2014 (P=0.13). Conclusions - For acute stroke trials, neither recruitment efficiency nor recruitment rates have increased over the past 25 years and, if anything, have declined.},

IMPORTANCE Clearer delineation of the phenotypic heterogeneity within behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) will help uncover underlying biological mechanisms and improve clinicians' ability to predict disease course and to design targeted management strategies. OBJECTIVE To identify subtypes of bvFTD syndrome based on distinctive patterns of atrophy defined by selective vulnerability of specific functional networks targeted in bvFTD using statistical classification approaches. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective observational study, 90 patients meeting the Frontotemporal Dementia Consortium consensus criteria for bvFTD underwent evaluation at the Memory and Aging Center of the Department of Neurology at University of California, San Francisco. Patients underwent a multidisciplinary clinical evaluation, including clinical demographics, genetic testing, symptom evaluation, neurologic examination, neuropsychological bedside testing, and socioemotional assessments. All patients underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging at their earliest evaluation at the memory clinic. From each patient's structural imaging scans, the mean volumes of 18 regions of interest (ROI) constituting the functional networks specifically vulnerable in bvFTD, including the salience network (SN), with key nodes in the frontoinsula and pregenual anterior cingulate, and the semantic appraisal network (SAN), anchored in the anterior temporal lobe and subgenual cingulate, were estimated. Principal component and cluster analyses of ROI volumes were used to identify patient clusters with anatomically distinct atrophy patterns. Data were collected from from June 19, 2002, to January 13, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Evaluation of brain morphology and other clinical features, including presenting symptoms, neurologic examination signs, neuropsychological performance, rate of dementia progression, and socioemotional function, in each patient cluster. RESULTS Ninety patients (54 men [60{\%}]; 36 women [40{\%}] ; mean [SD] age at evaluation, 55.1 [9.7]  years) were included in the analysis. Four subgroups of patients with bvFTD with distinct anatomic patterns of network degeneration were identified, including 2 salience network-predominant subgroups (frontal/temporal [SN-FT] and frontal [SN-F] ), a semantic appraisal network-predominant group (SAN), and a subcortical-predominant group. Subgroups demonstrated distinct patterns of cognitive, socioemotional, and motor symptoms, as well as genetic compositions and estimated rates of disease progression. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Divergent patterns of vulnerability in specific functional network components make an important contribution to the clinical heterogeneity of bvFTD. The data-driven anatomic classification identifies biologically meaningful anatomic phenotypes and provides a replicable approach to disambiguate the bvFTD syndrome.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Academy of Neurology. There is urgent need for clinical trials of novel interventions to reduce the burden of acute ischemic stroke. A key impediment to such trials is slow recruitment. Since obtaining written informed consent in the setting of acute stroke is especially challenging, some experts have endorsed relaxing the requirement for informed consent by permitting verbal consent or waivers to facilitate recruitment. This systematic review of 36 randomized controlled trials of acute interventions for ischemic stroke assesses whether alternatives to written informed consent are associated with increased recruitment rates. After the exclusion of 2 outlier trials that differed from other trials in conduct and interventions studied, no association was observed on univariable analysis (8.9 participants/month in trials requiring written consent vs 6.1 participants/month in trials with alternatives, p 0.43) or multivariable analysis (when adjusting for the number of centers, number of countries, and exclusions based on modified Rankin Scale scores). Alternatives to written informed consent in acute stroke trials may enable trial designs that would not be feasible otherwise. However, we did not find evidence that, within traditional trial designs, such alternatives are associated with faster recruitment.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016. Background: Black and Hispanic older Americans are less likely than white older Americans to possess advance directives. Understanding the reasons for this racial and ethnic difference is necessary to identify targets for future interventions to improve advance care planning in these populations. Methods: The aim of the study was to evaluate whether racial and ethnic differences in advance directive possession are explained by other demographic factors, religious characteristics, and personal health values. A general population survey was conducted in a nationally representative sample using a web-enabled survey panel of American adults aged 50 and older (n = 2154). Results: In a sample of older Americans, white participants are significantly more likely to possess advance directives (44.0{\%}) than black older Americans (24.0{\%}, p  {\textless}  0.001) and Hispanic older Americans (29.0{\%}, p = 0.006). Gender, age, retired or disabled employment status, educational attainment, religious affiliation, Internet access, preferences for physician-centered decision making, and desiring longevity regardless of functional status were independent predictors of advance directive possession. In fully adjusted multivariable models with all predictors included, black older Americans remained significantly less likely than white older Americans to have an advance directive (odds ratio [OR] = 0.42, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]  = 0.24-0.75), whereas the effect of Hispanic ethnicity was no longer statistically significant (OR = 0.65, 95{\%} CI = 0.39-1.1). Conclusion: In a nationally representative sample, black race is an independent predictor for advance directive possession. This association remains even after adjustment for other demographic variables, religious characteristics, and personal health values. These findings support targeted efforts to mitigate racial disparities in access to advance care planning.},

abstract = {Many neuropsychiatric disorders are marked by abnormal behaviour and decision-making, but prevailing diagnostic criteria for such behaviours are typically qualitative and often ambiguous. Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (also called semantic dementia) are two clinical variants of frontotemporal dementia with overlapping but distinct anatomical substrates known to cause profound changes in decision-making. We investigated whether abnormal decision-making in these syndromes could be more precisely characterized in terms of dissociable abnormalities in patients' subjective evaluations of valence (positive versus negative outcome) and of time (present versus future outcome). We presented 28 patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 14 patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, 25 patients with Alzheimer's disease (as disease controls), and 61 healthy older control subjects with experimental tasks assaying loss aversion and delay discounting. In general linear models controlling for age, gender, education and Mini-Mental State Examination score, patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia were less averse to losses than control subjects (P {\textless} 0.001), while patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia discounted delayed rewards more steeply than controls (P = 0.019). There was no relationship between loss aversion and delay discounting across the sample, nor in any of the subgroups. These findings suggest that abnormal behaviours in neurodegenerative disease may result from the disruption of either of two dissociable neural processes for evaluating the outcomes of action. More broadly, these findings suggest a role for computational methods to supplement traditional qualitative characterizations in the differential diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

This reflects the traditional view that physicians must never knowingly compromise the care of their patients, even for the sake of future patients. Equipoise has proven to be deeply problematic, especially in the Third World. Some recent critics have argued against equipoise on the grounds that clinical research is fundamentally distinct from clinical care, and thus should be governed by different norms. I argue against this "difference position," and instead take issue with the traditional, exclusively patient-centered account of physicians' obligations that equipoise presupposes. In place of this traditional view, I propose a Kantian test for the reasonable partiality that physicians should show their patients, focusing on its application in clinical research and medical education.},

abstract = {The abnormalities seen in Turner syndrome (monosomy X) presumably result from haploinsufficiency of certain genes on the X chromosome. Gene dosage considerations lead to the prediction that the culpable genes escape X inactivation and have functional homologs on the Y chromosome. Among the genes with these characteristics are those residing in the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) of the sex chromosomes. A pseudoautosomal location for a dosage-sensitive locus involved in stature has been suggested based on the analyses of patients with deletions of a specific segment of the short arm PAR; hemizygosity for this putative locus probably also contributes to the short stature in Turner individuals. We have isolated a gene from the critical deleted region that encodes a novel homeodomain-containing transcription factor and is expressed at highest levels in osteogenic cells. We have named the gene PHOG, for pseudoautosomal homeobox-containing osteogenic gene. Its deletion in patients with short stature, the predicted altered dosage in 45,X individuals, along with the nature of the encoded protein and its expression pattern, make PHOG an attractive candidate for involvement in the short stature of Turner syndrome. We have also found that the mouse homolog of PHOG is autosomal, which may help to explain the lack of a growth abnormality in mice with monosomy X.},
